# Nixobolus
Automated creation of bootable NixOS images

## Work in Progress
This repository is a work in progress and is subject to change at any time. Please note that the code and documentation may be incomplete, inaccurate, or contain bugs. Use at your own risk.

## Dependencies
To use this tool, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

- [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) package manager.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for cloning this repository.
- [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/), [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), and [yq](https://kislyuk.github.io/yq/) for manipulating configuration files and generating templates.
- [SOPS](https://github.com/mozilla/sops) (optional) for encrypting and decrypting configuration files.

## Usage

1. Configure

    Simply edit the example.yml file or create your own to define the settings for your deployment. Each machine is represented as a list item with key-value pairs for various settings.

    Settings declared in the "general" section apply to all hosts and will be overwritten by the values in host section if they are the same. Any settings not explicitly defined in the configuration file section will default to the values specified in the corresponding Jinja2 templates, which can be found under the templates_nix folder.

2. Generate

    Run the `build.sh` script with the path to your configuration file as the argument. This will render the Nix configuration files from the Jinja2 templates and build the initrd and kernel for each configured machine using the `nix-build` command.

    ```
    $ ./build.sh --help
    Usage: ./build.sh [-p] [-k] [-o output_dir] [-v] [--nix-shell] [config_file]

    Options:
    --nix-shell           Run nix-build command within a nix-shell development environment
    -p, --prompt          Prompt before performing crucial actions (e.g. overwriting or deleting files)
    -k, --keep-configs    Keep intermediate nix configurations generated by Nixobolus
    -o, --output          Specify output directory (default: './result')
    -v, --verbose         Enable verbose mode

    If config_file is not specified, the script will read from standard input.
    Config files should be in YAML or JSON format and be formatted correctly.
    ```

3. Deploy
    
    Once you have generated your images, you can use [kexec](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kexec) or [iPXE](https://ipxe.org/start) to boot the desired image.

## TODO

- [x] Home-manager
- [x] Secret management using SOPS
- [ ] Flakes
- [ ] Support for adding multiple users
- [ ] Option to build images in Docker/Podman
- [x] Divide Ethereum template into smaller parts
- [ ] Proof of concept [WebUI](https://github.com/ponkila/HomestakerOS)

## Roadmap

- [ ] Stage 1
    - Work on EL and CL client configurations
    - Streamlined installation and configuration process for Nix package manager
    - Documentation of tried and tested configs for initial users comparison and feedback

- [ ] Stage 2
    - Work on validator client configurations
    - Support for ARM hardware (in addition to x86)
    - Documentation for different options for secure key storage
    - Mimic and test realistic UX for a new home-staker

- [ ] Stage 3
    - Further improvements
    - Fine-tuning of documentation and overall UX
    - WebUI

- [ ] Stage 4
    - Complete documentation stating any constraints
